<p> Pochettino disclosed that it looks as if he has aggravated the existing problem after he was forced off in the final minute last night.

    The Blues finished the game with ten men having used all their substitutions. The West Londoners are already without several of their first-team players through injury, including summer signings Christopher Nkunku and Romeo Lavia.
    
    Reece James, Carney Chukwuemeka, Trevoh Chalobah, Benoit Badiashile, Wesley Fofana, and Marcus Bettinelli are all also on the treatment table.
    
    Nkunku and Lavia are yet to make an appearance for Chelsea this season with the former expected to return to full training in December while the latter is set to be available for selection ahead of their Premier League game against Arsenal in October.Ben Chilwell is expected to be out for four weeks with a hamstring problem, but early assessments have played down fears of a more significant injury.

    The 26-year-old defender has had his scans pushed back to Friday, after limping off at the end of Chelseas 1-0 Carabao Cup win over Brighton on Wednesday.
    
    He is considered certain to miss Chelseas next two matches, against Fulham and Burnley, before the October international break.
    
    A four-week absence would be considered a good outcome, but there is concern more broadly about vice-captain Chilwell, who suffered his third hamstring injury in the collision with Billy Gilmour since the beginning of last season.
    
    Marc Cucurella or Ian Maatsen are battling to replace Chilwell for Chelseas clash at Fulham on Monday.
    
    Mauricio Pochettino now has nine players out injured, with Malo Gusto and Nicolas Jackson also suspended for the trip to Craven Cottage.
    
    Gareth Southgate is not expected to be able to call Chilwell into his latest England squad, which will be announced next Thursday for the friendly with Australia and Euro 2024 qualifier against Italy.
